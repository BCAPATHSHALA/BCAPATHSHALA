<h1 align="center">🙋🏻‍♂️ About Me 👋</h1>

I’m Manoj Kumar, a Full Stack Web Developer with over 3 years of experience.

💼 I worked full-time at **Urbantract India Pvt Ltd** as a developer, where I built web apps using **Next.js, React, Node.js, and MongoDB**.

🧑‍💻 I also work as a **freelancer**, helping clients build websites, tools, and SaaS apps for their businesses.

🚀 I’ve launched projects on **Product Hunt**, solved **400+ DSA problems**, and know how to use **Docker, GitHub Actions, and AWS** to deploy apps easily.

🎓 I’m currently learning more at **100xDevs Cohort 3.0**, growing my skills and building new things.

I enjoy coding, exploring new tools, working on side projects, and sharing what I learn.

Feel free to connect with me if you’d like to build something cool together!
