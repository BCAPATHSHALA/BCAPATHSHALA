### 🙋🏻‍♂️ About Me
Hi there! I'm Manoj Kumar, a developer with a strong passion for creating robust and scalable web applications. I completed my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) in 2020, and since then, I've been working on honing my skills in both frontend and backend development.

### ⚙️ What I Do:
- 🧩 **Frontend:** I work with `HTML`, `CSS`, `SCSS`, `Tailwind CSS`, `JavaScript`, and `Typescript`. I use frameworks and libraries like `React.js`, `Chakra UI`, `Daisy UI`, `Redux Toolkit`, and `React Router DOM` to build dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

- 🧩 **Backend:** I specialize in `Node.js` and `Express.js` to create powerful APIs and backend services. I use tools like `Multer`, `Mailgen`, `Nodemailer`, `Winston`, `OAuth2.0`, `JWT`, and `Express Validator` to handle various backend tasks efficiently.

- 🧩 **Database:** I am proficient with `MongoDB` for managing and scaling data effectively.

### ⚙️ Additional Skills:
- 🏆 I have a solid understanding of **Data Structures and Algorithms**, which helps me solve complex problems efficiently.
- 🏆 I am knowledgeable in **Low-Level Design** for optimal system performance.
- 🏆 I am also skilled in **Java** and **C++**, which broadens my ability to work across different technologies.

### ⚙️ Deployment:
I have experience with deployment tools and practices such as `Git & GitHub` for version control, `Docker` for containerization, `PM2` for process management, and `NGINX` for web servers and reverse proxy. I also use `Vercel` and other cloud services like AWS, and Google Cloud for deploying applications.

### 🧑🏻‍💻 Searching Job Opportunities:
I am currently looking for opportunities as a **Software Development Engineer (SDE)**, **Backend Developer**, **Frontend Developer**, or **Full Stack Developer**.
